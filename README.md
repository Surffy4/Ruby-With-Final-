# Ruby-With-Final-
In the original challenge I managed to complete tier 1 as well as 1, 3, and 4 of tier 2. I have failed to make my score system work. I could not complete any of tier 3 which included creating a second stage for Ruby to teleport to and cog ammo limitation.
The visual changes I have added to the game were two characters that have different punching animations. You can see them at the start of the game and they do not do anything else but punch the air. I did this as it was an easy way to fulfill the requirements as well as it was funny.
The one audio change I did attempt to add was an audio for picking up cogs however I could not get Ruby to pick up the cogs. The one audio I did add and get to work was the sound made when the player presses X to interact with Jambi.
The single change I did make was incorporating a pickup object to the game that increases the players speed. The donut when picked up by the character using a 2D box collider and collision detection will add to the players speed by. Although there are many donuts so it would be best to limit your consumption of them since it would make playing more difficult even to the point that you become so fast that you clip through the land barrier and can walk on water. As for the second change I did not add since my scoring system doesn't even work.
